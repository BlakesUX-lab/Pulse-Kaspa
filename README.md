# PULSE  
### A Kaspa-Native, Attention-Based Social Media Platform

## Overview
Pulse is a mobile-first social media platform designed to reward genuine attention rather than engagement chasing. Instead of ads, likes, or algorithmic manipulation, Pulse introduces a transparent, attention-based value system that fairly rewards both viewers and creators.

This project was created as part of **Kaspathon 2026**.

---

## Problem Statement
Modern social media platforms:
- Monetize user attention without compensating users
- Lack transparency around how value is distributed
- Rely on addictive feedback loops and engagement metrics

Pulse rethinks this model by treating attention as a shared, measurable resource.

---

## Core Concept
Pulse is built around a simple idea:
- Viewers earn value by giving real attention to content
- Creators earn value based on actual watch time
- Value is shared instantly and transparently

---

## Key Features
- **Unified Feed**  
  Short and long video, image, and text content in a single stream.

- **Attention Progress Indicator**  
  A circular visual that fills as content is watched, representing attention over time.

- **Rewards Overview**  
  Clear summaries of value earned through attention.

- **Share & Split Appreciation**  
  Instantly share earned value with collaborators, followers, or other viewers.

- **Transparency Hub**  
  Simple explanations of how attention becomes shared value.

## How Kaspa Enables Pulse
Pulse was designed specifically with Kaspa in mind. As one of the fastest Layer-1 Proof-of-Work blockchains, Kaspa enables value to move as quickly as digital human interaction.

Kaspa (and Kaspa-supported stablecoins) allow Pulse to distribute micro-rewards instantly as content is watched and to split value among multiple participants in real time. Kaspa functions as invisible infrastructure, without forcing users to interact with blockchain mechanics.
